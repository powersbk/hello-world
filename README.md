# hello-world
This is my first time trying anything with coding. I took on a new job and, although my new boss knows I don't know how, I am expected to learn a lot of new skills. I feel this is a skill I need to know anyhow, since I am in the digital world and hope to be further immersed in it.
It's funny how I thought the only thing I cared about when going for my undergrad was obtaining an English degree because I love books so much. I know find myself more drawn to digital design and marketing rather than writing. The thought of being a teacher makes my stomach churn.
